## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will review basic code for standard
survival analysis, then work through examples for more complex
scenarios. The majority of the focus will be on creating the correct
dataset using tools available in the `survival` package. The final
portion of the class will explore the most complex scenario - multistate
data.

## Learning objectives

\[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES\]

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field with
survival data (or who anticipate needing to work with it). A very basic
understanding of survival analysis will be helpful, though not required.

  - Have you had to manipulate data prior to running time-to-event
    analysis?

  - Do you anticipate needing to run analyses with time-dependent
    covariates or multiple endpoints?

  - Have you downloaded and used R a bit?
    
      - *Even better,* have you used the `survival` package?

## Instructor

Beth Atkinson has been a statistician at Mayo Clinic for 29 years and
has worked with Splus then R since starting at Mayo. She has worked
extensively with Terry Therneau, author of the `survival` package, and
has spent many hours wrangling data so that it is set up appropriately
for various time-to-event analyses. Currently she is working with Terry
and Cindy Crowson on a book focused on time-to-event analyses, which
will include an on-line compendium of detailed examples.

## Pre-work

Welcome to the [Wrangling Survival
Data](https://github.com/bethatkinson/rmed2019_surv) workshop\! We look
forward to meeting you in person. Before attending the workshop, please
complete the following prework:

<br> <br>

1.  Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at <https://rstudio.cloud/>
    before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google
    or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new
    account with another password you have to remember).

2.  Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:
    
      - A recent version of R (\>=3.6.0), which is available for free at
        <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
      - A recent version of RStudio Desktop (\>=1.2), available for free
        ([RStudio Desktop Open Source
        License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
      - The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting
        to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command
        line:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` r
    install.packages(c("survival", "survminer", "tidyverse"))
    ```

3.  Don‚Äôt forget your power cord\!

On the day of the workshop, I‚Äôll provide you with an RStudio Cloud
project that contains all of the course materials. We will use the
software listed above only as an important backup should there be
problems with the on-site internet
connection.
