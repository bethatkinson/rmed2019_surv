## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will review basic code for standard survival analysis, then work through examples for more complex scenarios.  The majority of the focus will be on creating the correct dataset using tools available in the `survival` package.  The final portion of the class will explore the most complex scenario - multistate data.   The format will be a mix of lecture and hands-on exercises. 

## Learning objectives

* Understand need for different data formats
* Create start/stop data using new tools
* Check data for errors
* Create multistate data and perform basic analysis

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field with survival data (or who anticipate needing to work with it). A very basic understanding of survival analysis will be helpful, though not required.  A basic understanding of R is assumed.

* Have you had to manipulate data prior to running time-to-event analysis? 
* Do you anticipate needing to run analyses with time-dependent covariates or multiple endpoints?

* Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various “panes” and “tabs”? For instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd) to the console?
  + *Even better,* have you used the `survival` package?

## Instructor

Beth Atkinson has been a statistician at Mayo Clinic for 29 years and has worked with Splus then R since starting at Mayo, including development work on the `rpart` package.  She has worked extensively with Terry Therneau, author of the `survival` package, and has spent many hours wrangling data so that it is set up appropriately for time-to-event analyses.  Currently she is working with Terry and Cindy Crowson on a book focused on time-to-event analyses, which will include an on-line compendium of detailed examples.
