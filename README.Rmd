## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will review basic code for standard survival analysis, then work through examples for more complex scenarios.  The majority of the focus will be on creating the correct dataset using tools available in the `survival` package.  The final portion of the class will explore the most complex scenario - multistate data. 

## Learning objectives

[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES]

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field with survival data (or who anticipate needing to work with it). A very basic understanding of survival analysis will be helpful, though not required.  

- Have you had to manipulate data prior to running time-to-event analysis? 

- Do you anticipate needing to run analyses with time-dependent covariates or multiple endpoints?

- Have you downloaded and used R a bit? 
  - *Even better,* have you used the `survival` package?

## Instructor

Beth Atkinson has been a statistician at Mayo Clinic for 29 years and has worked with Splus then R since starting at Mayo.  She has worked extensively with Terry Therneau, author of the `survival` package, and has spent many hours wrangling data so that it is set up appropriately for various time-to-event analyses.  Currently she is working with Terry and Cindy Crowson on a book focused on time-to-event analyses, which will include an on-line compendium of detailed examples.
