## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will review basic code for standard survival analysis, then work through examples for more complex scenarios.  The majority of the focus will be on creating the correct dataset using tools available in the `survival` package.  The final portion of the class will explore the most complex scenario - multistate data. 

## Learning objectives

[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES]

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field with survival data (or who anticipate needing to work with it). A very basic understanding of survival analysis will be helpful, though not required.  

- Have you written or collaborated on a medical manuscript to submit for publication to a peer-reviewed journal? Are you familiar with common components of a medical manuscript like a "Table One", other summary tables, plots, text and citations?

- Have you downloaded and used R a bit? Can you install and load packages?
  - *Even better,* have you used `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`? 

- Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various "panes" and "tabs"? For instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd) to the console? 
  - *Even better,* have you tried to knit `r emo::ji("yarn")` an R Markdown document to some kind of output format like HTML, PDF, or Word?

## Instructor

Beth Atkinson has been a statistician at Mayo Clinic for 29 years and has worked in Splus then R for that entire time.  She has worked extensively with Terry Therneau, author of the `survival` package.  Currently they are working on a book focused on various aspects of survival analysis, including an on-line compendium of detailed examples.
